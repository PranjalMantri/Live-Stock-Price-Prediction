# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project aims to predict the future stock prices of a given company using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The user can input the name of the company and the duration for which they want to predict the stock prices.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- yfinance

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.

    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras yfinance


## Usage

1. Clone the repository

2. Navigate to the project directory

        cd <repository>


3. Run the script

        python stock_price_prediction.py


4. Enter the stock name and prediction duration when prompted

        Enter stock name to predict prices: <stock_name>
        Enter number of days to predict stock prices: <duration>


5. View the predicted future stock prices graph
